# BBHack-EX
 An extended (and maintained) version/decompilation of BBHack by Uyuyuy9.

This decompilation is meant to be used as a launching-off point for more intensive MOTHER editor projects.

If Uyuyuy9 wishes for me to remove this repository, I will do so, no questions asked.

My main goal of this project is to maintain and give BBHack more features for MOTHER modding as well as support with my very own disassembly, now that more data structures are being exposed.

This is my first actual Java project, and if it sucks bad, that's on me! Please feel free to make this better.

This may not be a complete 1:1 of BBHack, but it is functional.
